# Responsible AI Principles for Media Deployment

1. **Accountability** – All content must be traceable to human oversight.
2. **Fairness** – Avoid reinforcing stereotypes or algorithmic bias.
3. **Transparency** – Clearly disclose when AI tools are used in content creation.
4. **Accuracy** – AI outputs must undergo human fact-checking.
5. **Public Trust** – Maintain editorial credibility even with automation.

These principles underpin the safe and ethical use of GenAI across all workflows.
