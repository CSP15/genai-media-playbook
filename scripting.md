# Use Case â€“ AI-Assisted Scripting

## Problem:
Journalists and producers face time pressure in drafting show scripts, headlines, and segment summaries.

## Solution:
Use GenAI tools (e.g., GPT-based apps) to generate first drafts from briefs, improve tone consistency, and adapt content for different audiences.

## Workflow:
- Input: Show brief + audience profile
- Output: Draft script (editable)
- Review by editorial team for factual accuracy and tone
